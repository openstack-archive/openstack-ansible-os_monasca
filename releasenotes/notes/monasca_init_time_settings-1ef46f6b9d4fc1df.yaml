features:
  - The ``monasca_sigkill_timeout`` was introduced to control
    the time between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
    stopping or restarting services. This can help in letting long-lived
    sessions drain while preventing new ones from starting before a
    restart. Default is 120 seconds (was harcoded to 300 seconds).
  - The ``monasca_restart_wait`` variable has been added to control the time
    between service restarts. Default is 5 seconds (was hardcoded to 150
    seconds).
